                    <p>
                        I am a software developer from the Nashville area who enjoys designing and building software. The collaborative process of thinking about how a system will be built and designed is as much fun and challenging as the process of writing the software and building the system. I've always had an interest in software, but I never considered it as a candidate for a career until I began studying Information Management during my time at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. During my last year and a half at UT studying business, I took classes that involved building databases for a real company. That was the time when I began pursuing a career in software development. Now that I've completed a full-stack boot camp, I've integrated many different, small pieces of knowledge about technology and software into a bigger, more complete picture.

                        MyGrades is an application I built for students to keep track of, and make calculations on, the grades they receive in their college or high school courses. The "What Do I Need" feature allows a student to calculate a grade that they need to get on an upcoming assignment (homework, exam, project, etc.) in order to get a specific grade (chosen by the user) in the course based on previous grades in the course. MyGrades was built using the Angular framework, with a hint of jQuery. MyGrades stores data using Google's Firebase platform, and was styled with Bootstrap.</p>

                        I worked on this project in a team of 4 people, and we followed the SCRUM Sprint methodology. We worked on this project for two week-long sprints. The Djangazon project is an e-commerce web application, similar to Amazon, that was built using the Django framework. Users can buy and sell products, like/dislike products, give ratings to purchased products, and recommend products to friends (via username). My team and I also built a recommendation engine that recommends products to users, based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index">Jaccard Index's</a> similarity coefficient (relative to other user's like/dislike patterns).

                <p>
                    At the time of being hired for this job, I had a limited understanding of a few programming principles such as using variables, conditionals, looping, and basic string manipulation. Within the first month, my boss asked me to begin studying Android mobile app development to eventually produce an app for UT's Facilities Services Department. My boss had never written a line of code before, nor had anyone else in my department. Due to my own lack of experience, and my boss's lack of clarity about what he wanted and how he wanted it done, I had no idea where to begin. But it was at this time o during this process where I developed the ability to efficiently research concepts and find answers to my questions through the use of search engines, stackoverflow.com and other forums.

                    <p>An immersive, full-time boot-camp that trains full-stack software developers for 6 months.</p><br>
                    <p>During the first three-month session I started and/or contributed to many different projects. I built and styled static web apps with vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS. As well, I built modular, single page applications using Immediately Invoked Functional Expressions (IIFEs), <a href="http://browserify.org/articles.html">Browserify</a> and <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>. At the end of the first front-end session, I built a capstone project called MyGrades, links to it can be found below.</p><br>
                    <p>In the second, back-end session, I built command line interfaces, web applications, and a truly RESTful API.
                    I consistently used Python, the Django framework, and the Django REST Framework. I designed Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) and built relational SQL databases. I built SQL databases using the django framework's object relational mapper by migrating data models into SQLite3 tables. I also manually built and maintained SQLite3 databases through the use of SQL statements in a simple database browser, <a href="http://sqlitebrowser.org/">DB Browser</a>.</p><br>
                    <p>Over the course of this six-month boot-camp, I consistently used Git and GitHub to manage project source and version control. I occasionally worked on an individual projects, but spent most of my time working in diverse groups solving many different kinds of problems. My time at NSS was an incredible experience in which I productively worked with an awesome cohort of smart, good people.</p>

During my time in Knoxville, I discovered that I enjoyed building databases and building the software to interact with databases more than what I was about receive a bachelor's degree in. This opportunity was possible because the business school at my University allows students to choose an area to receive a collateral degree in, and I chose Information Management. Around this time, I decided to pursue a career in software development by applying to the Nashville Software School.</p>
